<br>According to the CDC, you are likely immune to rubella due to childhood exposure.

            NB: "Birth before 1957 provides only presumptive evidence for measles, mumps, and rubella.
            Before vaccines were available, nearly everyone was infected with measles, mumps, and rubella
            viruses during childhood. The majority of people born before 1957 are likely to have been infected
            naturally and therefore are presumed to be protected against measles, mumps, and rubella.
            Healthcare personnel born before 1957 without laboratory evidence of immunity or disease should
            consider getting two doses of MMR vaccine."
