    It should be noted that immunity conferred by the mumps vaccine (commonly received as a component of the MMR combo) is being observed to wane over time.<br>
    This diminished immunity over time is being suggested to compound weakened herd immunity due to underimmunisation, becoming a factor in recent measles outbreaks in underimmunised populations.
    As a consequence, the CDC is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/health-departments/MMR3.html" title='CDC guidance for public health authorities on use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during mumps outbreaks'>beginning to recommend</a> a MMR booster in some circumstances.
